## Multi Agent Pacman Capture the Flag
In this assignment, we want you to familiarize yourself with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and po- tentially explore different methodologies for implementing other agents. More specifically, the environment under investigation is the Pacman Capture the Flag Contest1, where the aim is to develop agents for con- trolling both Pacman and the ghost in coordinated team-based strategies.
